# **Face Recognition Using Viola-Jones and CNN**

This project implements a face recognition system combining the Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and recognition.

---

## **Features**
- **Face Detection**: Viola-Jones algorithm to detect faces in real-time.
- **Feature Extraction**: CNN-based feature extraction for improved accuracy.
- **Augmentation**: Automated data augmentation for better model generalization.
- **Training**: ResNet50 model fine-tuned for face recognition.
- **Attendance System**: Real-time face recognition for logging attendance.
